# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
In this project, data from previous Kickstarter campaigns is analyzed to provide recommendations for future campaigns. It focuses specifically on campaigns for plays. Below are results provided for each campaign launch date

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


Kickstarter campaigns for theaters launched in May, June, and July are the most successful
In the graph, May, June, and July had the highest success rates. As more campaigns were launched during this time period, the failed rate increased slightly. On the other hand, the success rate went up dramatically.

Kickstarter campaigns for theaters launched in December revealed to be the least successful.
According to the graph the month December had the lowest success rate. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Theatre Kickstarter campaigns with a fundraising goal of less than $1000 are the most successful.

Campaigns with goals under $1,000 experience the highest success rate of about 80%, according to the Outcome Based on Goals graph. However, goals set between $45,000 and $49,999 achieved the lowest successful rate of 0%.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
When populating the result-based goals sheet, I found it extremely difficult to enter formulas into the "Number Success", "Number Fell", and "Number Canceled" cells. For this reason, I used absolute cell references so I could easily copy the formula from row to row.
I initially encountered errors because the formulas for "Number Success", "Number Failed", and "Number Canceled" required specific notations. To fix this error, each comma, apostrophe, and quotation mark must be properly placed.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Conclusion 1 - In warmer weather, theatre plays are more likely to be successful. According to the graph, the most successful campaigns were launched in May, June, and July. This is normally the warmest time of year. 
Conclusion 2 - During colder weather, theatre plays were not successful. Based on the graph, campaigns launched in December had the lowest success rate. December is usually a cold month. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The data suggests that goals of $45,000 and higher are almost certain to fail.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
N/A

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

For the "Theatre Outcome Based on Launch Date" data I would have used a column or even a stacked bar chart to compare the successful, failed and canceled projects. Also, the "Outcome Based on Goals" data would have been best presented with a stacked bar chart as well, especially considering that the data is expressed in percentages, and it appears that success complements failure. For example, goals under $1,000 have a success rate of just under 80%, while the chances of them failing are just above 20%, giving you a total of 100%. In this case, a stacked bar chart would have worked perfectly.
